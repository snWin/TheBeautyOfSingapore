Angular is a JavaScript Framework which allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Applications(SPAs).
Single Page - There is only one HTML file, but a bunch of JavaScript code.
It gives the user a very reactive user experience because Javascript is very fast to reach out to a server.

URL, Universal Resource Locator, is the unique web address of any webpage in the address bar.
URI, Uniform Resource Identifiers, identifies a resource and differentiates it from others by using a name, location, or both.
